user-callback
=============

During the backup process, `Back In Time <https://github.com/bit-team/backintime>`_ can call a user-callback script at different steps.
This callback is ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/backintime/user-callback`` 
(by default ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is ``~/.config``).

- The first argument is the profile id (1=Main Profile, ...).
- The second argument is the profile name.
- The third argument is the reason:

1. Backup process begins.
2. Backup process ends.
3. A new snapshot was taken. The extra arguments are snapshot ID and snapshot path.
4. There was an error. The second argument is the error code.

  Error codes:

  1. The application is not configured.
  2. A "take snapshot" process is already running.
  3. Can't find snapshots folder (is it on a removable drive ?).
  4. A snapshot for "now" already exist.

5. On (graphical) App start.
6. On (graphical) App close.
7. Mount all necessary drives.
8. Unmount all drives.
